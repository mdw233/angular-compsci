# AngularCompsci

This project exists for a few reasons:

* I like Angular4+ and want to experiment with various parts of the framework
* I also want to bone up on some computer science theory via some exercies

So I'll do both at the same time.  Cool!

# Building

It is an Angular4+ project using the Angular CLI.

## To Run

* clone the repo
* `cd angular-compsci1`
* `ng serve --open`
